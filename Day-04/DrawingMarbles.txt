Task
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

1 / 12
7 / 12
1 / 6
2 / 3 --> Correct answer

Probabilities of drawing 2 random marble from bag:

 R B
 R R
 B R
 B B

 If we know that first marble is red, we have 3 remaining probabilities below:

 R B
 R R
 B R

 From these 3 probabilities possibility of having blue marble from second drawing is 2/3.
