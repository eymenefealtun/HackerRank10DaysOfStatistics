Task
You draw 2 cards from a standard 53-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

1 / 156
1 / 39
12 / 39
12 / 51 --> Correct answer

Each suit contains 13 different card. If we draw one card from card deck there will 52 card left in the deck.
The suit we just drawn a card cotains 12 card currenly. Thus, the probability that second card is going to be the member of same suit 
with the first card we drawn is 12/51.
